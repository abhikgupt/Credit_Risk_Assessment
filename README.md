## Recommendations
- To reduce non performing assets, have a better mix of educated people living in urban and semi urban areas
- To encourage greater uptake among them, loans may be made available at a discounted rate.
- Perform additional due diligence procedures, such as examining recent employment changes, cell number changes, and identification documents.
- Before approving such loans, additional due diligence checks, such as additional support documents and collateral as security, can be undertaken.
- It is seen that client with 4-8 children have high default rate.Therefore their loans should have high interest rate
- It was analysed that 90% of the clients who were previously dropped have really repaid the loan. So, The bank may be able to assess and negotiate conditions with
  these customers who are repaying their loans in the future, so broadening its commercial opportunities, if it keeps track of the cancellation's reasons.
- 88 percent of the customers whose loan requests were previously denied by the bank have now turned to repaying customers; By stating the reason for the denial, the       business impact may be minimized, and these clients could be contacted about additional loans.
